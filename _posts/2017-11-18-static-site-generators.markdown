# What I think of Jekyll and its peers

People create web sites out of a lot of reasons. Sometimes you want full control over everything - to 
put the image in the right place, add another side bar or otherwise change the layout. Without having used 
SSG:s much, it seems to me that such a site would be better maintained with Adobes Dreamweaver. 

I would however go for SSG:s when it comes to sites that pour out lots of text, such as blogs or
some low key new sites. Also SSG has a higher security level than sites that are generated from 
a server, which is a factor to recon with.
