# Presenting myself

I am a student at Linnaeus University, doing a two year program in programming for the Web. I live in 
Vetlanda, a small town in southern Sweden with a wife, a dog and two kids. 

Up until now my academic formation has been in the human sciences: mainly Philosophy and Theology. But at the age of 47 I decided
I needed to switch careers. As a young boy I was in the first generation to have some kind of computer 
at home: a [Sinclair ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81) with 1 kb RAM! Computers weren't mainly for
games and apps in those days, but for learning programming: so I learnt the language [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC)
at the age of 12, and I think that is why my life has taken this course now.

## Other interests

- Playing the electric and acoustic guitars.
- Cooking (I make a sensational pizza!)
- TV-series from the 1990's, and other in that vein.
